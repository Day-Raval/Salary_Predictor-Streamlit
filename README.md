# Salary_Predictor-Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. In this web app, I have performed the prediction on the Salary_data.csv file and employed the Linear Regression Model on the dataset. The Streamlit framework deployed the model on the web. The app has a **home** page, **predict** page, and **Contribute** page.
